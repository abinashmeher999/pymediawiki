A package to extract the list of categories for a wikipedia page. Uses MediaWiki API. Aspires to cover all the features listed in the [MediaWiki API:Properties](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Properties). Yes the name will change upon inclusion of more features. :smile:

We have a specially curated [list of resources](https://github.com/abinashmeher999/wikipedia-category/wiki/Resources#first-time-contributors) needed for this project in case you are a first time contributor. Check it out!

NB: This repository is more focussed towards first time contirbutors who are new to Github and Open Source.
